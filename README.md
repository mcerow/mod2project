## Introduction

In this project, we set out to come up with a linear regression model that predicts the amount of delay time an accident causes. We used the 'US Accidents' dataset available on kaggle.com to build our model. We shrunk our scope to only look at accidents that happened in 2019.

The questions we're answering in this model - 

  1. What features impact our target variable delay time?
  2. How much do these feature impact delay time, meaning how big are our coefficients?
  3. How accurately can we predict delay time given these features?
  
 In order to start our analysis, we used the following libraries:
 
 ### Data Cleaning:
  1. NumPy
  2. Pandas
  3. Matplotlib
  4. Seaborn
  
### Modelling:
  1. NumPy
  2. Pandas
  3. Matplotlib
  3. Seaborn
  4. Train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection
  5. Metrics from sklearn
  6. Stats from SciPy
  7. OLS from Statsmodels.formula.api
  8. Statsmodels.api
  9. Pairwise_tukeyhsd from statsmodels.stats.multicomp
  10. Multicomparison from statsmodels.stats.multicomp
